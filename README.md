# Restaurant Reviews Project

A Restaurant Review Application for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program.

## Getting started

**Installation**

_Cloning the repository_

```
git clone https://github.com/circular-code/restaurantReviews.git
```

_Dependencies and server_

- all project dependencies are included, except for python, which you have to download from their website. This project was created with python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

- In a terminal cd into the project folder and run my HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. You can do this by running `python -m serve.py`

(Sadly the standard serving via `python3 -m http.server 8000` did not work because of this [error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49566059/service-worker-registration-error-unsupported-mime-type-text-html))

- Now you can visit the site at: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around. The sites works on all different devices, have a go!
- The sites also caches your requests with the help of a service worker, so you can use it offline, after visiting once.

## License
